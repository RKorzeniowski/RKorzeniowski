# Welcome to my blog! 
I’m Renard, an Applied Scientist at Amazon, and my fascination with artificial intelligence began in childhood. The spark? Playing _Warcraft III_ and wondering, _“How does the computer know what to do?”_ Though the bots relied on simple rules, that curiosity ignited a lifelong journey into AI—one that eventually led me to where I am today.

I’ve always believed that true understanding comes from building things yourself. That’s why I’m passionate about AI: every hypothesis can be tested empirically. If an idea works, the results speak for themselves; if it doesn’t, the data tells you why. Here, I’ll share insights that blend intuitive explanations, mathematical rigor, and hands-on code. Sure, you can create magic by running someone else’s code—but to become a wizard, you’ll need to master all three.

This blog focuses on what excites me most: emerging paradigms (like diffusion models), transformative trends (think agentic AI), practical techniques that drive real-world results, and deep dives into _why_ systems work. While AI moves fast, I aim to spotlight ideas with lasting impact.

Ultimately, this space is my learning playground. Being able to explain clearly is the ultimate test of understanding, after all. If my explorations shed light on AI’s mysteries for you too? Consider that the best bonus!
