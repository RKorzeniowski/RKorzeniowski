The pace of artificial intelligence innovation in 2025 isn’t just accelerating—it’s redefining what’s possible. Imagine AI agents that don’t just follow instructions but orchestrate entire workflows autonomously, like resolving customer service issues end-to-end, processing payments, and even detecting fraud in real time—all while mimicking human reasoning. Healthcare is witnessing a revolution, too: passive monitoring devices now track your health metrics 24/7, flagging anomalies like cognitive decline through voice analysis or detecting early-stage diseases with 99% accuracy—sometimes before symptoms even appear. Meanwhile, multimodal AI is breaking creative barriers, transforming text prompts into cinematic-quality videos or crafting interactive virtual worlds that adapt to user inputs in real time. And for everyday magic, tools like Microsoft Copilot Vision analyze your screen’s content to summarize meetings, prioritize tasks, or even explain complex diagrams—making productivity feel almost effortless. This isn’t just progress; it’s a leap into a future where AI isn’t a tool but a collaborator, reshaping work, health, and creativity in ways we’re only beginning to grasp. But to get there we need to solve a few critical problems.

But bridging this gap requires tackling quite a few thorny challenges head-on, to mention some of them. First, the data drought plagues niche domains like rare disease diagnosis and ultra-personalized robotics—where datasets either don’t exist or can’t feasibly scale to the trillion-token appetites of modern models. Second, today’s computational engines struggle to keep pace with the real world’s chaos: autonomous drones still stutter when processing dynamic environments, burning unsustainable energy to analyze shifting variables like weather or crowds. Third, while GPT-4 can write a sonnet, it falters at long-horizon planning—imagine an AI construction manager failing to adjust timelines when a material shortage arises six months into a project. Fourth, even state-of-the-art models harbor inaccurate world models, like believing "turning up a thermostat cools a room" (a real GPT-4 error). Fifth, hallucinations persist as silent saboteurs—medical AIs inventing plausible-but-fake drug interactions or legal tools citing non-existent precedents. Finally, the elephant in the room: backpropagation. This 50-year-old algorithm remains the backbone of modern AI, but its inefficiency and biological implausibility limit systems like Tesla’s Optimus robot, which can’t afford days of training to learn a single new task. Solving these isn’t just academic—it’s the price of admission for an AI future that’s truly robust, adaptive, and aligned with our messy reality.

## Neuroscience Perspective<a name="sec_neuro_per"></a>

While the quest to mimic biological neural systems has driven AI since its inception—from McCulloch and Pitts’ foundational neuron models to today’s deep learning architectures—modern neuroscience is pushing the boundaries of how and why we replicate the brain. Traditional neural networks, including transformers, abstractly mirror synaptic connections, but the field is now diving deeper into biophysical realism and embodied cognition to bridge gaps in adaptability and efficiency. For instance, neuromorphic computing leverages silicon neurons and memristive devices to emulate the brain’s event-driven, energy-efficient computation, enabling systems like Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that process temporal data with 100x lower power consumption than conventional GPUs. These architectures replicate not just connectivity but also synaptic plasticity, mimicking the brain’s ability to strengthen or weaken connections based on experience—a feature critical for lifelong learning without catastrophic forgetting.

Critically, neuroscience is challenging AI’s reliance on brute-force scaling. The brain’s ability to learn with minimal data and correct errors without full backpropagation—a process mirrored in emerging algorithms like Bayesian synaptic plasticity—is driving research into alternatives to backpropagation, which remains biologically implausible and computationally costly. For instance, Tesla’s Optimus robot leverages neuromorphic principles to adapt locomotion in real time, sidestepping days of retraining. The future lies not in slavishly replicating the brain but in distilling its principles: efficiency, adaptability, and embodied intelligence.

## Developmental Psychology Perspective <a name="sec_dev_per"></a>

Just as aviation engineers looked to birds to design airplanes—not by replicating wings but by distilling principles of aerodynamics—AI researchers are increasingly turning to developmental psychology to uncover functional insights from human learning, particularly in children. This approach prioritizes understanding how biological systems solve challenges like generalization, efficiency, and adaptability, rather than slavishly mimicking neural structures. For instance, infants master intuitive physics by age two with minimal data, relying on object-level reasoning and violation-of-expectation mechanisms, a paradigm now guiding AI systems like PLATO to learn physical concepts from segmented visual inputs. Similarly, children’s socio-cognitive development—joint attention, scaffolding, and cultural learning—has inspired tools like the SocialAI School, which trains agents to navigate human-like social interactions using Bruner and Tomasello’s theories. 

## Multiple Discovery <a name="sec_mul_disc"></a>

Examples below were independently rediscovered via AI reserachers while striving to improve machine learning system. Why rediscovered? Because those mechanism were present in humans for a very long time. By reverse-engineering developmental milestones—whether through myelination-inspired inference or toddler-like active exploration—AI systems gain the flexibility and sample efficiency that brute-force scaling alone cannot provide. As diffusion models increasingly adopt human-like “early heuristics” to fix outputs quickly, the synergy between developmental psychology and AI promises not just better machines, but new lenses to understand intelligence itself.

1. Quantization as Cognitive Chunking
  
    Humans simplify sensory input through discretization (e.g., categorizing colors into “red” or “blue”), mirroring techniques like Vector Quantized VAEs (VQVAEs), which compress data into discrete latent codes. This parallels infants’ early perceptual grouping, where coarse categories precede nuanced distinctions. By emulating this “chunking,” AI systems reduce computational overhead while preserving essential patterns.

4. Knowledge Distillation & Neural Pruning
   
    The brain’s consolidation phase—pruning weak synaptic connections during sleep—finds its AI counterpart in model compression. Techniques like weight pruning or feature matching between large and small models mimic developmental “synaptic downselection,” optimizing efficiency without sacrificing performance. For example, Penn State’s ESS framework achieves 15% accuracy gains by integrating childhood-like environmental context into training.

5. Inference Speed-Up via Myelination Analogues

   Just as myelination accelerates neural signal transmission in the brain, AI deploys graph compilation and hardware optimizations to streamline inference. This reflects a shift from “training-centric” to “deployment-aware” design, prioritizing latency reduction—a lesson from how children automate learned skills (e.g., counting) into rapid, subconscious processes.

7. Critical Periods & Foundational Learning

   Children’s developmental windows, like language acquisition before age seven, underscore the importance of early exposure. AI models, too, struggle to learn novel concepts if not introduced during initial training—a phenomenon observed in physics-aware models like PLATO, which require object-centric data from the start to generalize. This aligns with findings that multimodal AI curricula inspired by child development (e.g., spatial reasoning → causal abstraction) improve robustness.

9. Active, Curriculum-Based Learning

   Infants actively seek stimuli matching their current competence (e.g., focusing on edges before complex shapes), a strategy mirrored in AI’s curriculum learning. Models trained on progressively harder tasks—low-resolution images → high-resolution scenes—achieve better generalization, akin to toddlers’ staged mastery of motor skills. The SocialAI School formalizes this via parameterized environments where agents “grow” from basic joint attention to advanced cultural learning.

## Biologicaly Inspiered <a name="sec_biological_inspiration"></a>

The marriage of biology and artificial intelligence has yielded some of deep learning’s most transformative innovations. By studying natural systems—from neurons to curiosity-driven exploration—researchers have solved core challenges in AI design. Below, we dissect four foundational examples, their mathematical underpinnings, and their biological blueprints:

1. Neural Networks: Mimicking Neuronal Firing

**What it is:** Computational models inspired by biological neurons, where interconnected nodes process information through weighted connections.

**Math:** A neuron’s output is computed as 

$$ \sigma(W^Tx+b), $$

where $\sigma$ (e.g., $sigmoid$, $ReLU$) mimics the "all-or-none" firing threshold of biological neurons.

**Nature link:** Dendrites integrate signals (inputs), the soma computes a thresholded response (activation), and axons transmit outputs—directly mirrored in artificial neurons.

**Pseudocode:**
```python
def neuron(inputs, weights, bias):  
    weighted_sum = sum(w * x for w, x in zip(weights, inputs))  
    return activation(weighted_sum + bias)  
```

2. Attention Mechanisms: Borrowing Cognitive Focus

**What it is:** Systems that dynamically prioritize input features, inspired by how humans concentrate on salient stimuli (e.g., focusing on a face in a crowd).

**Math:** For input sequence $X$, compute attention scores 

$$ \alpha_{ij}=softmax(\dfrac{Q_{i}K_{j}^T}{\sqrt{d}}), $$

where $Q$, $K$, $V$ are query, key, value matrices.

**Nature link:** The visual cortex’s "spotlight" attention, where neurons amplify relevant signals (e.g., edges) while suppressing noise, directly informs transformer architectures.

**Pseudocode:**
```python
def attention(Q, K, V):  
    scores = Q @ K.T / sqrt(dim)  
    weights = softmax(scores)  
    return weights @ V  
```

3. Curiosity Loss: Emulating Intrinsic Motivation

**What it is:** A reward signal encouraging agents to explore novel states, mirroring how animals investigate unfamiliar environments.

**Math:** Curiosity 

$$ \mathcal{L} = \parallel f(s_t,a_t)−s_{t+1} \parallel ^2, $$

where $f$ is a learned forward model predicting the next state $s_t+1​.$

**Nature link:** Dopamine-driven exploration in mammals—where novelty triggers reward signals—is algorithmically replicated to solve sparse-reward RL tasks.

**Pseudocode:**
```python
def curiosity_reward(state, action, next_state):  
    predicted_next = forward_model(state, action)  
    intrinsic_reward = mse(predicted_next, next_state)  
    return intrinsic_reward  
```

4. LSTMs: Copying Memory Gating

**What it is:** Recurrent networks with gated memory cells, inspired by the brain’s ability to retain/forget information.

**Math:**

$$Forget\ gate:\ f_t = \sigma(W_f x_t + U_f h_{t−1} + b_f), $$

$$Input\ gate:\ i_t = \sigma(W_i x_t + U_i h_{t−1} + b_i), $$

$$Cell\ state:\ C_t = f_t \odot C_{t−1} + i_t \odot \tanh⁡(W_c x_t + U_c h_{t−1} + b_c), $$

where $W$ and $U$ are weight matrixes respectively for input $x$ and hidden state $h$ vectors, while $\odot$ is an element-wise product (Hadamard product).

**Nature link:** Hippocampal memory consolidation—where the brain strengthens or discards synaptic connections—is mirrored in LSTM’s gated state updates.

**Pseudocode:**
```python
def lstm_step(x_t, h_prev, C_prev):  
    forget_gate = sigmoid(W_f @ concat(h_prev, x_t) + b_f)  
    input_gate = sigmoid(W_i @ concat(h_prev, x_t) + b_i)  
    cell_update = tanh(W_c @ concat(h_prev, x_t) + b_c)  
    C_t = forget_gate * C_prev + input_gate * cell_update  
    output_gate = sigmoid(W_o @ concat(h_prev, x_t) + b_o)  
    h_t = output_gate * tanh(C_t)  
    return h_t, C_t  
```

These biologically inspired designs solve problems that purely statistical approaches struggle with:
Neural networks handle non-linear patterns via hierarchical processing, akin to cortical layers.
Attention reduces computational waste by focusing resources, much like the thalamus filters sensory input.
Curiosity loss overcomes sparse rewards, replicating evolutionary survival strategies.
LSTMs mitigate vanishing gradients by mimicking synaptic plasticity rules.

## Why Care About Nature's Problems? <a name="sec_uniq_human_int"></a>

When drawing from biology to solve AI challenges, discerning *what to emulate* versus *what to discard* is critical. Biological systems evolved under constraints that don’t bind artificial intelligence, freeing us to cherry-pick principles while sidestepping evolutionary baggage.  

1. **Mandatory Validity at Every Developmental Stage**  
   Humans must remain functional throughout maturation - toddler’s brain can’t crash during language acquisition. AI faces no such limitation: training can involve catastrophic failures as long as the final model converges. This allows radical experimentation, like neural architecture search algorithms that mutate through millions of invalid configurations before discovering optimal designs.
2. **Metabolic Upkeep**  
   Biological systems dedicate multiple brain areas and ~20% of energy to baseline functions (e.g., respiration). AI requires no such "overhead" and we should ignore neurological system and biases dedicated to this purpuse. Same goes to all cognitive hyper specializations related to survival in harsh environment while detrimental to general intelligence.
4. **Pain/fear responses**  
   Humans evolved intricate mechanisms to balance exploration exploitation dilemma. "Fight or flight" response, fear as an emotion itself. While they served us well they are quite specific to our limitations. If considered in a highly abstract way they could be useful but we should be careful not to get some "unintended luggage".

   
## Unique Aspects of Machine Intelligence <a name="sec_uniq_machine_int"></a>

What are unique aspect of how machines learn that what one machine learns can be instantly shared with all of them. That's why it's worth investing crazy ammount of money
into elite model while investing all the resources into a single person would not make sense. 

## Glimpses of the Future <a name="sec_future"></a>

What could we learn from dev psy. 
- [Lynda Smith Nips 2024] ideas about episodic learning, 
- leaning more on selective learning and making it more active, (check what other things were said). 
- feedback loops for adjusting task complexity
- "allowing models to explore the real world" rather than using static data. humans are not passive percivers but active explorers
- Copy study techniques to understand model behavior and compare with human learning biases (examples of hallucinations in humans)
- U-shaped developmental pattern (expert models as training wheels in early stages of training)
- intermodal integrations: build-in from very early on in humans and very important (check more on that)
- infant reason differently about social and non-social agents. infantes interpret actions of other social agents in terms of goals. They also encode events in terms of goals but only when it's performed by social agent
(attachment as basis of children social bonds?)
- Two systems 
  - explicit cognition: involves having awarness of knowledge or of thought process. Usually being able to describe it in words
  - implicity cognition: works outside of awarness and is hard to describe in words e.g. knowing how to ride a bike or feeling that animal is sick
- (learning as a group with hidden information rather than individuals?)
